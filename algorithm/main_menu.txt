Basics:
------------
The main menu, which is what the user will encounter as soon as they open the game, 
will need to include the following options.

1) See Rules 
2) Play Game 
3) See Highest Score 
4) Quit

------------
Operating main menu:
------------
We have three constraints for the menu:
1. The user needs to be able to try again if there is an invalid menu option
2. We want the user to be able to play again after finishing a game
3. The user needs to be able to select all four options

This means that the main menu will need to be displayed using a while loop, which 
pauses whenever it wants input from the user.

This problem has two parts:
Building and rebuilding the menu
Handling user input

Algorithm
-----
Step 1: Print the menu to the console
Step 2: Collect input from the user, store to "userOP"
Step 3: Check to see which option from the menu the user picked
Step 4: Perform action selected from the menu
	if 1, display Rules
	if 2, begin a game of cactus pot
	if 3, display the highest score
	if 4, quit
	if any other number, display error
Step 4: If the user did not choose "quit", repeat from step 1
